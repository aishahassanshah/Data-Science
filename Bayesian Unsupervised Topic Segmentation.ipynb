      "The documents were dubbed the Panama Papers because of the country they were leaked from however the Panamanian government expressed strong objections to the name over concerns that it would tarnish the government's and country's image worldwide as did other entities in Panama and elsewhere This led to an advertising campaign some weeks after the leak titled \"Panama more than papers\" Some media outlets covering the story have used the name \"Mossack Fonseca papers\"\n",
